# -Predictive-Maintenance


This project seeks to demonstrate possible failure modes of plot-fuselage gas turbine engines by constructing these responsive surfaces for engine sensors through a thermodynamic simulation model, while taking into account the flow and efficiency differences for the engine's primary components. Using a health index that broadly tracks operating margins, damage is modeled as a decreasing exponential of flow and efficiency over time from a threshold condition until the failure condition is reached. Value or Implications for Practice: The artificial time-series sensor data produced may improve predictive maintenance, and health monitoring of engines, and infrequent unscheduled non-predictive downtime eases of consultative maintenance.
